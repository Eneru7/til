> TIL = Today I Learned

These are notes on the little things I learn every day in every aspect, not just the technical side. These things don't really warrant a full blog post. One is to develop the habit of taking notes, and the other is to make it easier to summarize and organize them later.

这是我每天在各个方面学到的小东西的笔记，不仅包括技术方面。这些东西并不真正值得写成一篇完整的博客文章。一是培养记录的习惯，二是方便之后归纳整理。
